# 🚀 Terraform GCP VM Deployment (via GitHub Actions)

This project automates the provisioning and management of a **Google Cloud Compute Engine VM** using **Terraform**, fully integrated with **GitHub Actions**.  
All infrastructure changes — from creation to destruction — are managed directly from GitHub, ensuring a secure, repeatable, and version-controlled workflow.

## 🧱 Features

- **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)** using Terraform  
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD** for automated deploys and destroys  
- **GCP VM instance** creation with:
  - External IP and SSH access
  - Debian 12 base image
  - Startup script execution
- **Firewall rule** to allow secure SSH access
- Fully managed authentication via **GCP Service Account**
